# Personal Finance Tracker

## Description
As an avid mint mobile user I love tracking my finances. Unfortunately, Intuit decided that they will be shutting down the Mint Mobile app. With my newly acquired skills in CS 521 I went ahead and created a financial tracking application. This financial tracking app will track your spending for each month.
